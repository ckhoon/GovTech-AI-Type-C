Led by the Enabling Technology Collaboratory (ETC), together with Centre of Innovation for Complementary Health Products (COI-CHP) and Centre for Applied Behavioural Sciences (CABS), our pool of engineers, IT specialists and scientists work collaboratively to integrate core enabling technologies to innovate and create value for our partners to differentiate them from their competitors. Analytical Science . Artificial Intelligence . Behavioural Science . Cybersecurity . Immersive Media . Internet of Things TP has good Analytical Science capabilities that would be able to support Singapore-based Complementary Health Product (CHP) enterprises and other TP Tech Clusters meet the growing challenges and technological advances such as product formulation, chemical and biological analysis, as well as safety and efficacy testing. Through Artificial Intelligence (AI), TP works with organisations to develop smart mobile or web applications that incorporate Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and data analysis to automate and derive valuable insights, predictions, and recommendations to solve their business challenges. TP has good Behavioural Sciences capabilities and extensive experience in working with closely with industry partners in infusing behavioural science elements in their work. Through behavioural insights, TP can work with organisations on projects to influence or nudge behaviours in different domains, or to improve work processes or service delivery within the organisation. TP also leverages on behavioural design to work with organisations to improve the design and development of products and services, particularly for products or services that requires good usability, or developed to help users manage their behaviours. As companies go digital, a robust Cybersecurity system is essential to ensure the security of their processes and data. TP can assist by performing penetration testing, providing exposure to a range of cybersecurity testing tools, and supporting malware analysis. Immersive Media refers to technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. They play a vital role in developing our digital economy and support key sectors from engineering, media, healthcare, education and retail. Other than healthcare and education, TP works with organisations to expand the use of immersive media in manufacturing facilities, focusing on providing insights into maintenance and operations information and training and simulation. Internet of Things (IoT) is the outcome of convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, sensors, embedded systems and machine learning, enabling the exchange of data between devices and systems over the internet or other communication networks. IoT technology is essential in the development of “Smart Home”, “Smart Factory”, and “Smart City”, in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, transport, facility management etc. Read our customer stories What we can offer Artificial Intelligence Training, consultancy and research collaboration on Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) / Natural Language Processing (NLP) for (but not limited to) image detection, image recognition, building chatbots, and recommendation systems.
