This experience will facilitate their ability to adapt when joining the workforce in the future. SIP is usually carried out with local organisations in a relevant industry where students undertake various activities and experience problem-solving in practical, real-life situations. Alternatively, SIP can be held overseas (OSIP), where students can gain global exposure and valuable life skills. Please click here for more information on OSIP. Internship Period SIP starts between March and October and the duration generally ranges from 16 to 26 weeks. Please click here to view the internship duration and available period of the participating diplomas. The polytechnic processes the SIP applications as early as four months before the respective SIP periods to allow sufficient time for clarification, processing and allocation.

SIP Mentorship In line with the SkillsFuture movement, our polytechnic encourages organisations to provide mentorship to our students. The role of this mentor is different from the day-to-day internship work supervision and guidance typically undertaken by an assigned supervisor. A mentor takes on a long-term view to provide guidance, support, encouragement and inspiration to his/her student through sharing knowledge and experience relevant to work, career and/or professional development.

Interns undertake project work on the polytechnic's campus in Singapore followed by an overseas attachment for the rest of the attachment period.

Subject to negotiation, the host organisation should work with the polytechnic and assist in the following (where possible): Provide or source for suitable accommodation for the interns. Advise on insurance coverage/ immigration requirements for interns (if applicable). Liaise with the local authorities regarding the necessary documentation for the interns (if necessary).
