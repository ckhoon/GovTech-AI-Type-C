The research work is conducted by multi-disciplinary teams from our Advanced Manufacturing Centre (AMC), Robotics & Automation Centre (RAC), TP-Digital Fabrication & Additive Manufacturing Centre (DFAMC) and TP-HRG Robotics Innovation Centre (TP-HRGRIC). Our engineers and scientists integrate their core domain knowledge with data analytics, machine learning and Internet-of-Things, to develop cutting-edge industrial solutions. Through the Aviation Research Centre (ARC), TP also develops autonomous drones for various industrial applications. In addition, RAC is a member of the Centre of Innovation for Built Environment â€“ Robotics & Automation (COI-BERA) together with the Robotics Research Innovation Centre (RRIC) at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. COI-BERA seeks to develop and promote the adoption of robotics and automation technologies with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for the built environment sector. Advanced Manufacturing For the manufacturing industry, we develop solutions to digitalise and automate manufacturing systems; optimise the quality through artificial intelligence and data analytics; and assist companies to model and visualise manufacturing operations. We also specialise in additive manufacturing, where we develop process capabilities for different materials such as metallic alloys and ceramics. Robotics & Automation We have developed a patent-pending autonomous intelligent vehicle (AIV) platform that has been successfully customised and deployed in many companies, helping our local enterprises enhance productivity and achieve manpower savings. For drones, we aim to develop training systems to facilitate pilot training, and technologies and peripheral equipment to enhance drone operations.
