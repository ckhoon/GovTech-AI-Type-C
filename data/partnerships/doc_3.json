Together, the three centres and Future Foods Domain deploy science and technology to strengthen our food supply resilience and contribute to food security and safety. Being industry-centric in approach, our advanced facilities are well-equipped to provide consultancy services, research and training programmes in agriculture technology, aquaculture and future foods. Agriculture Technology We conduct leading research targeted at enhancing food security through increased farm productivity and sustainability of cropping systems. With our integrated research capabilities, we are able to synergise and meet challenges in plant science at national and international level. Aquaculture Technology We adopt a collaborative and integrated systems approach in providing innovative solutions to meet the needs of farms and enterprises. Our core competencies lie in aquaculture nutrition and feeds, health and disease management, breeding and seedstock development, smart and integrated intensive culture systems and practices as well as wastewater and energy resource management for sustainable and productive aquaculture. Future Foods We provide innovative solutions to challenges in enhancing the nutritional quality, safety, and sustainability of food production. Our research areas include alternative proteins and synthetic biology.
