Our scientists and engineers from the industry recognised Healthcare Engineering Centre (HEC), Centre for Applied Nutrition Services (CANS) and the SAC accredited Glycemic Index Research Unit work collaboratively with the industry, hospitals and regulatory bodies to develop solutions/formulations in healthcare, diagnostics, food, nutrition and culinary applications. Healthcare Engineering TP deploys a multi-disciplinary approach towards the development of BioMEMS (Biomedical micro-electro-mechanical systems) and flexible electronics-based healthcare devices and systems and continuously grow our research & development (R&D) capabilities in biosensors, microfluidics and wearable healthcare sensors. Projects we have worked on include microfluidics-based point-of-care devices for detection of sepsis and hand foot mouth disease; a paper-based diagnostic kit for detecting gout and kidney injury markers; and a flexible pressure sensor based Traditional Chinese Medicine Pulse Analyzer. Applied Nutrition We have a dedicated pool of food scientists, nutritionists, and chefs to support companies through a whole range of applied research and consultancy services related to healthier food product development, formulation of plant-based protein/alternative meat products, Glycemic Index and efficacy testing, nutrition intervention/clinical trials, culinary application and technology translation. Notably, we have successfully supported many companies develop, validate and launch a range of healthier food products, including low GI products, in Singapore and the region.
