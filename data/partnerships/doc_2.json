Research is done through TPâ€™s Clean Energy Research Centre (CERC), a leading centre in Singapore for fuel cell research, smart energy sensors and battery management system (BMS) development. With our experts in materials science, construction technology and nanotechnology from our Centre for Urban Sustainability (CUS), TP offers an integrated approach to our industry partners in providing advanced sustainable technologies. Energy Systems We have developed one of the most compact and energy-dense proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stacks globally. To support the advent of batteries in automobiles and industrial applications, we custom build and design battery management systems for companies to ensure their safety and reliability. Our energy management systems also incorporate data analytics and internet-of-things technologies to provide smart solutions for domestic and industrial applications. Sustainable Materials We support Singapore to become a zero-waste nation by recycling waste for various industrial applications, including sustainable geopolymer materials & structures and engineered cementitious concrete for prefabricated modular wall systems. Other materials of interest include asphalt concrete incorporated with plastics and novel insulating materials comprising bio-fibres.
