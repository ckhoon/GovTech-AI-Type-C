By applying expertise in various areas of behavioural sciences across disciplines, we work with organizations from multiple industries to address critical human behaviour issues to enhance their products, services, and operational processes. We have considerable experience working with industry partners from the social service and health and wellness sectors in developing, piloting and evaluating various programmes to improve work effectiveness and quality of life. Behavioural Insights BI can help enhance the initial formulation and design of organization policies, business strategies, product development, programme or service design by aligning them with an accurate human behaviour model. BI can also improve the ‘last mile’ implementation of policies, strategies, programmes and service delivery by nudging individuals towards engaging in desired behaviours. Programme Development We develop workplace wellness programmes to improve the well-being of employees and active ageing programmes to enhance older adults’ ability to age gracefully through brain training and physical activities. We also develop educational programmes that help young children build a growth mindset and resilience. These programmes encourage inter-generation interactions within the community.

Product, service or program design and development. Program or service delivery implementation. Designing interventions and solutions that target critical behaviours that can be changed through ‘nudging’ (i.e., increasing desirable behaviour and decreasing undesirable behaviours) Evaluate the impact and effectiveness of BI solutions or interventions designed to change behaviour Program Development Research, development & consultation services in: Conducting needs analysis so as to determine what programmes should be developed to help improve an organization. Conducting the necessary ‘deep-dive’ into existing research literature to understand best practices Developing programmes through an empirically informed process Piloting and refining programs through an iterative design process Evaluating the effectiveness and impact of developed programmes Behavioural Insights Research, training & consultation services in: Conducting exploratory studies to understand reasons why individuals engage or do not engage in certain critical behaviours, which may be useful for: Business strategies or policy formulation.
