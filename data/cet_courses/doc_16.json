Who Should Attend This UPP is ideal for TP current students or graduates who intend to pursue higher education at university, especially degree courses in Engineering, IT, or Applied Science. What You'll Learn The UPP consists of 4 different courses: 1. University Preparatory Programme English 2. University Preparatory Programme Foundation Mathematics 3. University Preparatory Programme Mathematics (Exemption Available!) 4. University Preparatory Programme - Physics *Note: UPP Foundation Mathematics is a pre-requisite module to the UPP Mathematics for polytechnic graduates/students without prior Calculus or Engineering Mathematics knowledge. In particular, this module is useful for graduates/students from the School of IIT, HSS, DES, BUS, and ASC (except Diploma in Chemical Engineering). It also serves as a refresher course for graduates from the School of Engineering who need to revise their Mathematics skill at polytechnic level before they start the UPP Mathematics module. Certification Participants who have met the 75% attendance requirement and have successfully completed and obtained a pass grade in a module will be awarded Certificate in University Preparatory [name of module]”. Participants who have met the 75% attendance requirement but did not sit for the examination or failed the module will be awarded a Certificate of Attendance.

I found it beneficial especially because it was about four years since I last learnt how to structure and write an academic essay in secondary school. My UPP tutors were well trained and taught the classes well. I would recommend this programme to students who are preparing for university studies.\" SHALOM LIM ERN RONG Graduate of Diploma in Business, Temasek Polytechnic Criminology and Security, Singapore Institute of Technology and University of Liverpool in Singapore \"UPP Mathematics has helped me hone my quantitative skills in many ways, challenging me in topics such as integrals and limits. During my admission interview in NUS, an officer daunted me when she said that University Mathematics is tough for a polytechnic graduate but once she saw the UPP Certification, she assured me that I’ll be fine. I would definitely recommend this program to students who would want to pursue engineering or mathematics related studies in the university.\" REBECCA TAN Graduate of Diploma in Business Process & Systems Engineering, Temasek Polytechnic Industrial & Systems Engineering, National University of Singapore \"I had a wonderful experience in the UPP Mathematics programme. I was able to garner vast knowledge that is relevant to my course in the university. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to meet helpful lecturers and coursemates. I believe the programme has equipped me with the mathematical foundation to help me progress through my journey in university.\" KOH HUI MIN Graduate of Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic Mechanical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University \"I feel fortunate to have enrolled in the UPP Mathematics programme. The programme has given me the opportunity to build up my mathematics foundation prior to starting my degree course. When I started university, I was able to manage the mathematics related modules. I’m glad that this programme exists so that students are able to better prepare themselves for university studies.\" KOH SHI HUI Graduate of Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic Mechanical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University Course Contact Enquire Now 67881212 Monday - Thursday: 8:30am - 6:00pm Friday: 8:30am - 5:30pm Closed during lunchtime, 12:00pm - 1:00pm and on weekends and public holidays.
